# Tragedy Classification: Antigone

## The Tragedy

**Title**: Antigone (*Antigone*)
**Playwright**: Sophocles (c. 496-406 BCE)
**First performance**: c. 441 BCE
**Status**: Complete
**Mythological cycle**: Theban (the aftermath of the Seven Against Thebes, the house of Oedipus)

### Synopsis
After the deaths of Eteocles and Polyneices, Creon decrees that Polyneices shall lie unburied. Antigone defies the decree and buries her brother, invoking the unwritten laws of the gods. Creon condemns her to be sealed alive in a rocky vault. Haemon, Creon's son and Antigone's betrothed, pleads for her life but is refused. The prophet Teiresias warns Creon that the gods are offended. Creon relents too late: Antigone has hanged herself; Haemon kills himself over her body; Eurydice, Creon's wife, stabs herself upon learning the news. Creon is left shattered, recognizing his catastrophic error.

## Six-Dimensional Analysis

### 1. The Chorus
The Chorus of Theban Elders produces the most celebrated Apollonian odes in surviving tragedy. The "Ode to Man" is the supreme statement of human capacity rendered in perfectly balanced strophic pairs: "Wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than man... And speech, and wind-swift thought, and all the moods that mould a state, hath he taught himself." The ode on Zeus's power and the curse of the house of Labdacus likewise maintains gnomic, morally searching Apollonian form. Throughout the play, the chorus functions as a deliberative civic body -- interpreting, advising, warning. But the last stasimon before the catastrophe is a hymn to Dionysus himself: "O thou of many names, glory of the Cadmeian bride... O Bacchus, dweller in Thebe, mother-city of Bacchants... thou visitest the ways of Thebe." The invocation of the Dionysiac god -- complete with torch-flames, ivy-mantled slopes, night-long frenzy, and Thyiads -- at the moment of supreme crisis is a remarkable formal irruption within an otherwise Apollonian choral architecture.

**Position**: Mixed -- The choral odes are paradigmatically Apollonian (the "Ode to Man," the Zeus ode), but the hymn to Dionysus immediately before the catastrophe introduces the Dionysiac as both theme and formal register.

### 2. Individuation
Antigone and Creon are among the most intensely individuated characters in Greek tragedy. Antigone's defense is a supreme act of moral self-definition: "it was not Zeus that had published me that edict; not such are the laws set among men by the justice who dwells with the gods below; nor deemed I that thy decrees were of such force, that a mortal could override the unwritten and unfailing statutes of heaven." Her selfhood is absolute, defined by principle, unbending. Creon is equally individuated: his speeches on authority, obedience, and civic order are forensic masterworks of political argument. The Creon-Haemon stichomythia is a supreme display of two bounded individuals clashing through rational debate. Haemon argues from practical wisdom ("the trees that yield to it save every twig"), Teiresias from prophetic authority. Every major voice in the play is sharply defined, rhetorically self-possessed, morally distinct.

**Position**: Apollonian -- Both protagonist and antagonist maintain fierce individuation throughout. Their moral positions are defined through deliberative, forensic speech. Even Antigone's defiance is articulated as principled argument, not ecstatic dissolution.

### 3. Suffering
The play's central sufferings occur offstage and are reported by Messengers in composed Apollonian narration. The discovery of Antigone hanging, Haemon's embrace and suicide, the blood streaming on her cheek -- "while sense lingered, he clasped the maiden to his faint embrace, and, as he gasped, sent forth on her pale cheek the swift stream of the oozing blood" -- this is horrific content rendered as painterly tableau, formally composed narrative that makes violence visible without enacting it. Eurydice's death is likewise reported. But Creon's final kommos breaks into chanted antiphonal grief: "Woe for the sins of a darkened soul, stubborn sins, fraught with death! / Ah, ye behold us, the sire who hath slain, the son who hath perished!" The formal boundary between spoken verse and chanted song is crossed as Creon's composed authority dissolves into lamentation.

**Position**: Mixed -- The central sufferings are narrated with Apollonian composure, but Creon's final kommos pushes grief beyond composed speech into chanted, formally fragmenting lamentation.

### 4. Resolution
The play achieves genuine moral resolution, though at devastating cost. Creon's recognition ("I have learned the bitter lesson") is authentic pathei mathos -- wisdom through suffering. Teiresias's prophecy is fulfilled exactly. The Leader's closing words deliver Apollonian gnomic wisdom: "Wisdom is the supreme part of happiness; and reverence towards the gods must be inviolate. Great words of prideful men are ever punished with great blows, and, in old age, teach the chastened to be wise." The cosmos operates according to intelligible divine justice: transgression, punishment, recognition, moral restoration. Yet the resolution is achieved through total destruction -- wife, son, and niece dead. The moral clarity comes at a price that tests whether "resolution" can meaningfully be claimed.

**Position**: Apollonian -- The play achieves clear moral resolution: the chorus articulates the lesson, Creon recognizes his error, divine justice is vindicated. Pathei mathos is enacted, not merely described.

### 5. Language and Music
The dominant register is forensic rhetoric and moral reasoning at its most elaborate. Antigone's defense speech, Creon's proclamations, Haemon's argument (with its natural analogies of yielding trees and taut sails), the Creon-Haemon stichomythia, and Teiresias's prophetic warning are all models of Apollonian deliberative language. The "Ode to Man" is the most famous instance of choral moral reasoning in all tragedy -- its language builds through systematic enumeration of human powers within perfectly maintained strophic form. But the Dionysiac hymn shifts into invocatory register: "O Bacchus, dweller in Thebe... with thine attendant Thyiads, who in night-long frenzy dance before thee." And Creon's final kommos abandons deliberation for the repetitive "woe is me" of lamentation that can no longer argue or reason.

**Position**: Apollonian -- The play's language is overwhelmingly deliberative, forensic, and morally structured. The Dionysiac hymn and final kommos are formally contained within this architecture.

### 6. Body and Boundaries
All deaths occur offstage and are narrated -- the strict Apollonian convention. The Messenger's account of the cave is formally composed reportage: each detail (the hanging, the embrace, the sword, the blood on the cheek) is rendered as image rather than enacted spectacle. Bodies are then displayed (Haemon's corpse carried onstage, Eurydice's revealed behind the doors). The thematic center of the play is the body of Polyneices -- the contested corpse whose burial or exposure determines the civic and divine order. The body as object of law, ritual obligation, and divine imperative is the play's governing concern. Antigone's ritual act -- the thrice-poured libation and sprinkling of dust -- is the formal restoration of the body to sacred order.

**Position**: Apollonian -- Violence is narrated, not enacted. The body is treated as an object of civic and religious deliberation. Even Antigone's burial rite is described as formal, composed, ceremonial.

## The Tension

### Where the poles collide
The collision is concentrated in two moments. First, the hymn to Dionysus: the chorus invokes the Dionysiac god by name, with imagery of torch-flames, frenzy, and night-long dance, at the moment of supreme crisis -- just before the catastrophe that will destroy Creon's world. The Apollonian civic chorus summons the Dionysiac as a healing power, but what follows is destruction, not cure. Second, Creon's final kommos: the ruler whose speeches have been models of Apollonian authority now chants in broken strophe-antistrophe pairs, his language reduced to "woe is me" -- the composed individual dissolved into grief.

### The dominant current
The Apollonian dominates overwhelmingly. The play is a structure of deliberative speeches, forensic arguments, stichomythic debates, and morally searching choral odes. Every major scene is organized as rational confrontation between defined positions.

### Trajectory
From Apollonian order through Apollonian confrontation toward moral resolution via catastrophe. The trajectory is not dissolution (as in The Persians or Agamemnon) but clarification: the play's movement is toward moral truth, achieved through the collision and destruction of opposed positions. The Dionysiac erupts only at the edges -- the hymn to Bacchus, Creon's final lamentation -- but the architectural frame holds.

### What the tension reveals
Antigone stages the confrontation between two forms of Apollonian authority: civic law (Creon) and divine law (Antigone). Both are articulated with supreme Apollonian clarity; both are maintained with absolute individual conviction. The play's tragedy lies in the impossibility of reconciling these within a single civic order. The hymn to Dionysus at the moment of crisis reveals what the Apollonian confrontation has concealed: that the forces at work exceed what rational argument and civic authority can contain. Creon's final dissolution shows that the Apollonian individual can be shattered by the consequences of his own Apollonian certainty.

**Overall**: MIXTURE (strongly Apollonian-dominant)

### Classification Statement
Antigone is one of the most Apollonian plays in the surviving corpus. Its architecture is forensic debate: every major scene is organized as a rational confrontation between sharply defined moral positions, articulated through deliberative rhetoric of the highest order. The "Ode to Man" and the Zeus ode are paradigmatic Apollonian choral reasoning. Antigone and Creon are fiercely individuated, their moral certainties expressed through composed, self-possessed speech. The play achieves genuine moral resolution through pathei mathos. Yet the hymn to Dionysus at the moment of crisis -- the Apollonian chorus invoking the god of dissolution -- reveals the formal tension at the play's heart: the Apollonian structure of debate and law cannot contain the forces it has unleashed, and the final kommos shows Creon's composed authority dissolved into chanted grief. The Dionysiac is present not as the play's dominant mode but as its limit-case: the point at which Apollonian certainty discovers its own insufficiency.

### Nietzsche's Own View
Nietzsche does not give extended analysis of the Antigone in The Birth of Tragedy, though his treatment of Sophocles emphasizes the Apollonian clarity of Sophoclean heroes and their "transfiguration through suffering." Hegel's famous reading of the play as a collision of equally valid ethical claims (family vs. state) is closer to an Apollonian interpretation. Nietzsche would likely have recognized the hymn to Dionysus as a moment of self-referential awareness within the dramatic form -- the Apollonian structure acknowledging the Dionysiac origin of tragedy itself.

## Textual Evidence

### Passage 1: Antigone's defense (divine law speech)
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "Yes; for it was not Zeus that had published me that edict; not such are the laws set among men by the justice who dwells with the gods below; nor deemed I that thy decrees were of such force, that a mortal could override the unwritten and unfailing statutes of heaven. For their life is not of to-day or yesterday, but from all time, and no man knows when they were first put forth."

**Why**: Supreme Apollonian moral individuation: a bounded self, articulating a principled position through deliberative speech. Antigone's defiance is not ecstatic but forensic -- she makes a legal argument, appealing from human law to divine law. The principium individuationis is fully intact; the individual stands against the state through the power of reasoned conviction.

---

### Passage 2: Ode to Man (first stasimon)
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "Wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than man; the power that crosses the white sea, driven by the stormy south-wind, making a path under surges that threaten to engulf him... And speech, and wind-swift thought, and all the moods that mould a state, hath he taught himself."

**Why**: The most celebrated Apollonian choral ode in tragedy. Perfectly maintained strophic form, systematic enumeration of human capacities, gnomic language that builds toward a moral climax. The verse celebrates the principium individuationis itself -- man as the being who masters nature through form, speech, and thought. The final warning ("Never may he share my hearth... who doth these things") maintains moral authority within the same composed register.

---

### Passage 3: Creon-Haemon stichomythia
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "CREON: Am I to rule this land by other judgment than mine own? / HAEMON: That is no city which belongs to one man. / CREON: Is not the city held to be the ruler's? / HAEMON: Thou wouldst make a good monarch of a desert."

**Why**: Perfect Apollonian stichomythia: balanced, line-for-line, each argument met with counter-argument. Two bounded individuals clash through rational debate. The form enacts the civic process of deliberation even as its content reveals the breakdown of civic consensus.

---

### Passage 4: Hymn to Dionysus (last stasimon)
**Classification**: Collision point
> "O thou of many names, glory of the Cadmeian bride, offspring of loud-thundering Zeus!... O Bacchus, dweller in Thebe, mother-city of Bacchants, by the softly-gliding stream of Ismenus... with thine attendant Thyiads, who in night-long frenzy dance before thee, the giver of good gifts, Iacchus!"

**Why**: The Apollonian civic chorus invokes the Dionysiac god by name, with imagery of torch-flames, nymphs, ivy-mantled slopes, and night-long frenzy. Formally, the ode maintains strophic discipline -- but its spirit calls forth the Dionysiac as a healing power at the moment of supreme crisis. This is the dramatic form acknowledging the presence of the very force its Apollonian structure has been organized to contain.

---

### Passage 5: Messenger's report (Haemon's death)
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "While sense lingered, he clasped the maiden to his faint embrace, and, as he gasped, sent forth on her pale cheek the swift stream of the oozing blood. Corpse enfolding corpse he lies; he hath won his nuptial rites, poor youth, not here, yet in the halls of Death."

**Why**: Horrific content rendered as composed Apollonian narration. The Messenger transforms violence into painterly image -- "the swift stream of the oozing blood" -- making the terrible visible through the beauty of formal description. The bitter irony of "nuptial rites... in the halls of Death" is Apollonian wit maintaining its composure over devastating material.

---

### Passage 6: Creon's kommos (final lamentation)
**Classification**: Dionysiac
> "Woe for the sins of a darkened soul, stubborn sins, fraught with death! Ah, ye behold us, the sire who hath slain, the son who hath perished! Woe is me, for the wretched blindness of my counsels! Alas, my son, thou hast died in thy youth, by a timeless doom, woe is me!--thy spirit hath fled--not by thy folly, but by mine own!"

**Why**: The ruler whose speeches have been models of Apollonian authority now chants in broken strophe-antistrophe pairs. "Woe is me" repeats through the kommos as language abandons deliberation for lamentation. The principium individuationis cracks: Creon can no longer command, argue, or compose -- he can only grieve. The formal shift from spoken verse to chanted song marks the Dionysiac dissolution of the Apollonian individual.

# Value Engineering -- SAVE International Methodology

## What is Value Engineering?

Value Engineering (VE) is a systematic method to improve value by examining functions and finding ways to deliver them at lower cost without sacrificing performance, quality, reliability, or safety.

**Value = Function / Cost**

## When to Perform VE

| Gate | VE Opportunity | Impact Potential |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| G0 | Concept alternatives (embedded in 3-alternative comparison) | Highest |
| G1 | System-level alternatives, technology selection | High |
| G2 | Component-level alternatives, material substitution | Medium |
| G3+ | Diminishing returns -- design is frozen | Low |

**Rule**: Maximum VE effort at G1-G2. After G3, VE becomes impractical.

## SAVE International Job Plan

### Phase 1: Information
- Gather project data: scope, design, cost, schedule
- Review constraints and requirements
- Identify cost drivers (Pareto: 20% of items = 80% of cost)

### Phase 2: Function Analysis
- Identify functions using **verb-noun** pairs:
  - "Transfer fluid" (pump), "Support load" (steel), "Convert energy" (turbine)
- Classify: **Basic** (primary reason) vs **Secondary** (supporting) vs **Unnecessary** (adds cost, no value)
- Build FAST Diagram: HOW? (left to right), WHY? (right to left)

### Phase 3: Creative
- Brainstorm alternatives for each function
- No evaluation during brainstorming -- quantity over quality

### Phase 4: Evaluation
- Screen for feasibility (technical, schedule, regulatory)
- Evaluate: cost savings, performance impact, quality impact, schedule impact, risk

### Phase 5: Development
- Detailed VE proposals for short-listed ideas
- Estimate savings (CAPEX and OPEX)
- Lifecycle cost analysis where appropriate
- Calculate net benefit

### Phase 6: Presentation
- Present proposals to stakeholders
- Decision: Accept / Reject / Defer
- Document rationale

## Common VE Opportunities in EPC

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Material substitution | Carbon steel vs alloy where corrosion allows; GRP vs SS |
| Standardization | Reduce valve types, pipe sizes, instrument types |
| Modularization | Pre-assembled modules vs field-built |
| Process simplification | Eliminate unnecessary steps or equipment |
| Layout optimization | Compact layout to reduce piping, cable, steel |
| Equipment sizing | Right-size (avoid over-design margins) |
| Construction method | Pre-cast vs cast-in-place; bolted vs welded |
| Specification review | Remove gold plating from specs |

## Lifecycle Cost Analysis

| Cost Element | CAPEX | OPEX (annual) | OPEX (design life) |
|-------------|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Equipment purchase | [EUR] | -- | -- |
| Installation | [EUR] | -- | -- |
| Energy consumption | -- | [EUR/yr] | [EUR total] |
| Maintenance | -- | [EUR/yr] | [EUR total] |
| Spare parts | -- | [EUR/yr] | [EUR total] |
| Replacement | -- | -- | [EUR] |
| Decommissioning | -- | -- | [EUR] |
| **Total** | **[EUR]** | **[EUR/yr]** | **[EUR total]** |

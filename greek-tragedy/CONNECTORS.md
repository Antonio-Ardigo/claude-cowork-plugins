# Connectors

This plugin works with Claude's built-in knowledge of Greek tragedy and Nietzsche's philosophy. No external connectors are required.

## Optional Enhancements

- **Web search**: For recent scholarly interpretations, translations, or fragmentary evidence
- **File system**: For reading user-provided texts or translations of tragedies
- **Markdown export**: Built-in -- every classification automatically exports as a `.md` file

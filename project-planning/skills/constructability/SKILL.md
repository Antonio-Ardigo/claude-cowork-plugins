# Constructability -- Engineering & Construction

## What is Constructability?

Constructability is the optimum integration of construction knowledge and experience in planning and design to achieve project objectives. The goal is to make the design easier, safer, faster, and cheaper to build.

## When to Perform Reviews

| Gate | Review Focus | Key Questions |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| G0 | Concept | Is the site buildable? Major access issues? |
| G1 | Pre-FEED | Module vs stick-built? Heavy lift feasibility? Camp location? |
| G2 | FEED | Detailed construction sequence? Lift plans? Laydown? Temporary works? |
| G3 | Design Freeze | Final method statements? All issues resolved? |

## Modularization Assessment

### Shop vs Field Trade-Off

| Factor | Shop Fabrication | Field Fabrication |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Quality | Higher (controlled environment) | Variable (weather, conditions) |
| Productivity | Higher (fixed tools, jigs) | Lower (temporary setup) |
| Cost | Lower labor cost/hour | Higher labor, but no transport |
| Transport | Module transport cost + complexity | No transport needed |
| Schedule | Parallel with site prep | Sequential with site readiness |

### Transport Constraints
- Road: Width ~5m, height ~5m, weight ~100-200 tonnes (route-dependent)
- Barge/sea: Width ~30m, height ~15m, weight ~15,000 tonnes
- Rail: Width ~3.5m, height ~4.5m, weight ~100 tonnes

### Modularize When:
- Remote site with limited skilled labor
- High labor cost location
- Repetitive units
- Quality-critical fabrication
- Schedule-critical path shortened by parallel fabrication

## Site Logistics

### Access
- Road access: load capacity, width, turning radii, height restrictions
- Bridge load ratings on transport routes
- Rail siding availability
- Port/jetty proximity for heavy lifts

### Laydown Areas
- Size: major equipment footprint + 50% working space
- Ground: compacted, level, drained
- Segregation: structural steel, piping, electrical, instruments
- Security and weather protection for sensitive items

## Temporary Works

### Construction Camp (G1 preliminary, G2 detailed)
- Accommodation: peak workforce x 1.2 margin
- Offices: PM, engineering, QA/QC, client, contractor
- Canteen/kitchen: sized for peak workforce
- Utilities: water, wastewater, power, telecom
- Waste management: domestic, construction, hazardous
- Medical facility, recreation, security

### Excavation
- Geotechnical survey required before design
- Cut/fill volumes, slope stability, shoring requirements
- Dewatering if water table is high
- Spoil management: reuse vs disposal
- Underground utilities survey before digging

### Temporary Roads
- Load capacity for construction traffic and heavy transport
- Surface: compacted gravel, concrete panels, or asphalt
- Drainage to avoid flooding and rutting

## Heavy Lift Planning

### Crane Selection
- Load chart: capacity at required radius and boom length
- Ground bearing pressure: crane pad design
- Lift radius and boom length calculation
- De-rating: wind speed limits, dynamic factors

### Lift Plan Contents
- Lift study (center of gravity, rigging arrangement)
- Crane setup diagram
- Ground conditions and pad design
- Exclusion zones
- Weather restrictions (max wind typically 10-15 m/s)
- Communication and emergency plan

## Construction Sequencing

### Typical EPC Sequence
1. Site mobilization and camp setup
2. Site clearing and earthworks
3. Piling (if required)
4. Foundations and underground services
5. Structural steel erection
6. Equipment setting (heavy lifts)
7. Piping installation (large bore first)
8. Electrical cable pulling and termination
9. Instrument installation and calibration
10. Insulation, fireproofing, painting
11. Pre-commissioning and commissioning

### Area-Based vs System-Based
- **Area-based**: Complete all disciplines in one area before moving to next
- **System-based**: Complete one system across all areas
- Most projects use a hybrid approach

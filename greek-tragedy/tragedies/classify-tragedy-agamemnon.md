# Tragedy Classification: Agamemnon

## The Tragedy

**Title**: Agamemnon (*Agamemnon*)
**Playwright**: Aeschylus (525-456 BCE)
**First performance**: 458 BCE (part of the Oresteia trilogy)
**Status**: Complete
**Mythological cycle**: House of Atreus (the curse of Thyestes, the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, the return from Troy)

### Synopsis
A Watchman on the palace roof awaits the beacon signaling Troy's fall. The Chorus of Argive Elders enters with a vast parodos narrating the omen of the eagles, the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, and a hymn to Zeus. Clytemnestra receives the fire-signal and announces the victory. A Herald confirms Troy's destruction. Agamemnon arrives in triumph; Clytemnestra persuades him to walk on purple tapestries into the palace. Cassandra, his captive prophetess, remains in the chariot and erupts into ecstatic vision of the house's past and imminent murders. Agamemnon's death-cries are heard offstage. Clytemnestra emerges over the bodies to justify her act. Aegisthus arrives; the chorus threatens future vengeance through Orestes.

## Six-Dimensional Analysis

### 1. The Chorus
The Chorus of Argive Elders performs the longest and most metrically complex parodos in surviving tragedy. Its strophe-antistrophe pairs move through multiple levels of narration -- the omen of the eagles, Calchas's interpretation, the sacrifice of Iphigeneia -- while maintaining rigorous formal structure. The famous "Zeus hymn" (strophe 3.2) is the supreme instance of choral moral reasoning in Aeschylus: "Men shall learn wisdom, by affliction schooled. / In visions of the night, like dropping rain, / Descend the many memories of pain / Before the spirit's sight: through tears and dole / Comes wisdom o'er the unwilling soul." Throughout the middle episodes, the chorus maintains its deliberative function -- questioning, interpreting, parsing Clytemnestra's double-edged language. But the later odes register escalating dread. After Agamemnon enters the palace, the chorus sings of an unnamed foreboding: "Wherefore for ever on the wings of fear / Hovers a vision drear / Before my boding heart?" And during Cassandra's scene, the choral voice becomes responsive rather than deliberative -- echoing, questioning, struggling to read her fragmented prophecy.

**Position**: Apollonian -- The chorus maintains formal discipline and moral reasoning throughout, even when registering fear. Its function as interpretive, deliberative civic voice is sustained more consistently than in any other Aeschylean play.

### 2. Individuation
Clytemnestra is the most sharply individuated character in Aeschylus, and among the most in all surviving tragedy. Her speeches are masterworks of controlled rhetoric, double meaning, and forensic argument. The welcome speech to Agamemnon layers genuine emotion with lethal irony -- "I hail my lord as watch-dog of a fold, / As saving stay-rope of a storm-tossed ship" -- every image carrying a hidden blade. The carpet-scene stichomythia is supreme Apollonian individuation: line by line, she dismantles Agamemnon's resistance through rhetorical manipulation. Agamemnon himself maintains bounded selfhood -- measured, deliberative, morally cautious ("A mortal man to set his foot / On these rich dyes? I hold such pride in fear"). But Cassandra shatters this register entirely. Her individuation dissolves under prophetic possession: "Apollo, Apollo!" repeated as pure invocation, her syntax fragmenting, her vision overwhelming rational speech. She does not argue or interpret -- she undergoes.

**Position**: Mixed -- Clytemnestra achieves the most sustained Apollonian individuation in Aeschylus; Cassandra represents its most violent dissolution, the principium individuationis shattered by prophetic possession.

### 3. Suffering
The play deploys multiple registers of suffering. The Herald's narration of the storm that scattered the Greek fleet is composed Apollonian reportage -- "Th' Aegaean sea-field flecked with flowers of death, / Corpses of Grecian men and shattered hulls" -- terrible images rendered with painterly precision. The sacrifice of Iphigeneia, narrated in the parodos, is likewise formally composed: horror made visible through measured, image-laden verse. Agamemnon's death occurs offstage and is heard as cries from within -- partially Apollonian (kept behind the skene), partially Dionysiac (the raw voice breaking through the dramatic surface). But Cassandra's suffering is neither narrated nor contained. She sees the children of Thyestes, she sees the bath and the net, she sees her own death -- and her verse enacts the seeing: "Hark! in the brimming bath, / The heavy plash -- the dying cry -- / Hark -- in the laver -- hark, he falls by treachery!" The language collapses into fragments as vision overwhelms speech.

**Position**: Mixed -- Suffering is formally composed in the parodos and Herald's speech, but Cassandra's prophetic suffering exceeds composition, the verse fragmenting under the weight of what it must express.

### 4. Resolution
The Agamemnon offers no resolution. It is the first play of a trilogy, and its ending is a deliberate suspension: Clytemnestra stands triumphant over the bodies, justifying the murder through rational argument ("He slew my child -- for that I slew him here"); the chorus threatens future vengeance through Orestes; Aegisthus arrives and the final exchange is a stichomythia of mutual threat. The moral positions are irreconcilable within the play's own frame. The chorus's pathei mathos -- wisdom through suffering -- describes a principle but does not enact resolution. The play ends in stalemate, not closure.

**Position**: Dionysiac -- The play refuses resolution at every level. Moral positions are irreconcilable, the dramatic action opens rather than closes, and the formal structure demands continuation beyond itself.

### 5. Language and Music
The Agamemnon contains the most elaborate linguistic architecture in surviving tragedy. The parodos is metrically and syntactically the most complex choral ode Aeschylus wrote, moving through multiple registers (narrative, prophetic, hymnic, gnomic) while maintaining strophe-antistrophe discipline. Clytemnestra's speeches are forensic masterworks -- every image is loaded with double meaning, every argument serves her concealed purpose. The carpet-scene stichomythia is the purest Apollonian dialogue: balanced line-for-line exchange in which rational persuasion is the explicit mode, though its content is lethal manipulation. But the Cassandra scene operates in a wholly different register. Her chanting begins with pure invocation -- "Apollo, Apollo!" -- and her verse progressively abandons argument for vision, syntax for cry, interpretation for enactment. "Away, away -- keep him away -- / The monarch of the herd, the pasture's pride" -- the language becomes a series of desperate imperatives as rational speech fails.

**Position**: Mixed -- The play's dominant register is the most elaborate Apollonian rhetoric in Aeschylus, but the Cassandra scene pushes language into incantatory, visionary, formally dissolving territory that exceeds deliberative speech.

### 6. Body and Boundaries
The murder of Agamemnon occurs offstage -- the Apollonian convention of narrated rather than visible violence. But the play systematically prepares and then transgresses bodily boundaries. The carpet scene is the crucial ritual: Agamemnon crosses from the chariot to the palace treading on purple dye, violating the boundary between mortal and divine ("such pomp beseems the gods, / Not me"). This crossing of the threshold is the visible enactment of the transgression that dooms him. After the murder, Clytemnestra appears standing over the bodies -- the violence is now visible, brought from behind the skene into the audience's sight. Cassandra's body too is a violated boundary: she is a prophetess possessed against her will, her body the instrument of Apollo's speech, her individuality invaded by divine force.

**Position**: Mixed -- The murder is kept offstage (Apollonian), but the carpet scene ritually enacts boundary transgression, and the display of bodies brings violence into the visible. Cassandra's possessed body collapses the boundary between self and divine other.

## The Tension

### Where the poles collide
The collision point is the Cassandra scene. For the first two-thirds of the play, the Apollonian register dominates absolutely: the parodos is formal reasoning at its most elaborate, Clytemnestra's speeches are forensic rhetoric at its most controlled, the stichomythia of the carpet scene is Apollonian dialogue perfected. Then Cassandra opens her mouth. "Apollo, Apollo!" -- and the entire register of the play cracks. Prophetic possession replaces deliberation; fragmented vision replaces composed argument; the cry replaces the sentence. The chorus, which has maintained its interpretive function throughout, is reduced to bewildered echo: "Too plain is all, too plain! / A child might read aright thy fateful strain."

### The dominant current
The Apollonian dominates by architecture. The parodos, Clytemnestra's speeches, the Herald's narration, the carpet-scene stichomythia, and even the post-murder justification speeches are all formally masterful Apollonian compositions. The majority of the play's lines operate in this register.

### Trajectory
The trajectory is from composed Apollonian order toward Dionysiac eruption. The play builds its Apollonian architecture with extraordinary patience and elaboration, then the Cassandra scene cracks it open. But unlike The Persians, the play does not end in Dionysiac dissolution -- Clytemnestra reasserts Apollonian composure in her justification speech. The ending is a tense standoff between irreconcilable positions, not a descent into ritual lamentation.

### What the tension reveals
The Agamemnon stages the confrontation between two forms of knowledge: Clytemnestra's rational, strategic, rhetorically controlled knowledge (the Apollonian mastery of language as instrument of power) and Cassandra's prophetic, ecstatic, formally ungovernable knowledge (the Dionysiac eruption of truth that exceeds what argument can contain). The play's devastating irony is that Cassandra's Dionysiac truth is more accurate than any Apollonian speech in the play -- she sees exactly what will happen -- yet no one can act on it. The Apollonian veil is not ignorance but willful composure in the face of what has already been revealed.

### Classification Statement
The Agamemnon is built on the most elaborate Apollonian architecture in surviving tragedy. Its parodos is the longest and most formally complex choral ode in Aeschylus; Clytemnestra's speeches are the most controlled forensic rhetoric; the carpet-scene stichomythia is the most perfectly balanced Apollonian dialogue. Yet the Cassandra scene cracks this architecture open from within. When the prophetess begins her chanting -- "Apollo, Apollo!" -- the register of the play shifts from deliberation to possession, from composed argument to fragmented vision, from the sentence to the cry. The play's genius lies in the relationship between these registers: the Apollonian edifice is not merely destroyed but shown to be complicit in the horror it conceals. Clytemnestra's supreme rhetorical control is itself a form of violence; Cassandra's ecstatic dissolution of form is the eruption of truth that no amount of composed speech can contain.

### Nietzsche's Own View
Nietzsche discusses the Oresteia in The Birth of Tragedy primarily in relation to the trilogy's ending (the Eumenides and the founding of the Areopagus). He sees the Oresteia as Aeschylus's supreme demonstration of tragedy's capacity to contain both principles. The Agamemnon would exemplify his argument about the Apollonian veil: the formally beautiful surface through which the Dionysiac truth becomes endurable. Cassandra is the figure who tears this veil -- the Apollonian prophet (she serves Apollo) whose speech is Dionysiac (ecstatic, formally dissolving, exceeding rational interpretation).

## Textual Evidence

### Passage 1: Zeus Hymn (parodos, strophe 3.2)
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "'Tis Zeus alone who shows the perfect way / Of knowledge: He hath ruled, / Men shall learn wisdom, by affliction schooled. / In visions of the night, like dropping rain, / Descend the many memories of pain / Before the spirit's sight: through tears and dole / Comes wisdom o'er the unwilling soul-- / A boon, I wot, of all Divinity, / That holds its sacred throne in strength, above the sky!"

**Why**: The supreme Apollonian moral statement in Aeschylus: pathei mathos rendered in metrically disciplined, gnomic, theologically coherent verse. The chorus speaks as an authoritative civic body delivering intelligible cosmic principle. Suffering is made meaningful through formal wisdom.

---

### Passage 2: Clytemnestra's welcome speech (carpet scene)
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "I hail my lord as watch-dog of a fold, / As saving stay-rope of a storm-tossed ship, / As column stout that holds the roof aloft, / As only child unto a sire bereaved, / As land beheld, past hope, by crews forlorn, / As sunshine fair when tempest's wrath is past, / As gushing spring to thirsty wayfarer."

**Why**: Every image is a composed, rhetorically balanced analogy -- and every one carries lethal double meaning. "Watch-dog" echoes the Watchman's opening, "storm-tossed ship" the Herald's storm, "column stout" the palace that will become his tomb. Clytemnestra's mastery of Apollonian form is itself the weapon. The principium individuationis is intact: she is completely self-possessed, completely in control.

---

### Passage 3: Carpet-scene stichomythia
**Classification**: Collision point
> "CLYTEMNESTRA: Was it fear made this meekness to the gods? / AGAMEMNON: If cause be cause, 'tis mine for this resolve. / CLYTEMNESTRA: What, think'st thou, in thy place had Priam done? / AGAMEMNON: He surely would have walked on broidered robes. / CLYTEMNESTRA: Then fear not thou the voice of human blame. / AGAMEMNON: Yet mighty is the murmur of a crowd."

**Why**: Formally perfect Apollonian stichomythia -- balanced, line-for-line, rational exchange. But the content enacts the dissolution of Agamemnon's moral boundaries. Each of Clytemnestra's lines is a precise rhetorical instrument dismantling his resistance. The Apollonian form of dialogue is used to accomplish the transgression it ostensibly deliberates.

---

### Passage 4: Cassandra's first chanting
**Classification**: Dionysiac
> "Woe, woe, alas! Earth, Mother Earth! and thou / Apollo, Apollo! [...] Apollo, Apollo! / God of all ways, but only Death's to me, / Once and again, O thou, Destroyer named, / Thou hast destroyed me, thou, my love of old!"

**Why**: The register of the play cracks open. "Apollo, Apollo!" -- pure invocation, repeated, the name functioning as cry rather than address. The syntax fragments; the verse abandons argument for exclamation. Cassandra's speech is formally the opposite of Clytemnestra's: where Clytemnestra commands language, Cassandra is commanded by it. The principium individuationis dissolves under prophetic possession.

---

### Passage 5: Cassandra's vision of the murder
**Classification**: Dionysiac
> "Away, away -- keep him away -- / The monarch of the herd, the pasture's pride, / Far from his mate! In treach'rous wrath, / Muffling his swarthy horns, with secret scathe / She gores his fenceless side! Hark! in the brimming bath, / The heavy plash -- the dying cry -- / Hark -- in the laver -- hark, he falls by treachery!"

**Why**: The verse has become a series of desperate imperatives and fragmented images. "Hark!" repeated -- language pointing toward pure sound, the splash and the cry. Cassandra does not describe the murder; she undergoes it in prophetic vision, and the formal dissolution of her verse enacts the violation she witnesses. The language has ceased to interpret and has become the event itself.

---

### Passage 6: Chorus responds to Cassandra
**Classification**: Collision point
> "Distraught thou art, divinely stirred, / And wailest for thyself a tuneless lay, / As piteous as the ceaseless tale / Wherewith the brown melodious bird / Doth ever Itys! Itys! wail, / Deep-bowered in sorrow, all its little life-time's day!"

**Why**: The chorus attempts to contain Cassandra's Dionysiac eruption within an Apollonian interpretive frame -- comparing her to the nightingale, using the mythological parallel of Procne and Itys. But the comparison acknowledges what it cannot control: Cassandra's cry, like the nightingale's, is "tuneless" -- it exceeds the formal measure the chorus tries to impose. The Apollonian interpretive faculty recognizes its own failure.

---

### Passage 7: Clytemnestra's post-murder justification
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "He slew my child -- for that I slew him here" (implied in argumentation structure)
> "Zeus, Zeus, Fulfilment's lord! my vows fulfil, / And whatsoe'er it be, work forth thy will!"

**Why**: After the Dionysiac eruption of the Cassandra scene and the offstage murder, Clytemnestra reasserts Apollonian composure. Her justification is forensic argument -- cause and consequence, crime and punishment, rational moral calculus. The Apollonian veil is restored, but it now covers visible blood. The formal composure that enabled the murder now justifies it.

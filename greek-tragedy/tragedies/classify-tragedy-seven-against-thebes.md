# Tragedy Classification: Seven Against Thebes

## The Tragedy

**Title**: Seven Against Thebes (*Hepta epi Thebas*)
**Playwright**: Aeschylus (525-456 BCE)
**First performance**: c. 467 BCE
**Status**: Complete
**Mythological cycle**: Theban (the curse of Oedipus on his sons)

### Synopsis
Seven Argive champions, led by Polyneices, besiege the seven gates of Thebes. Eteocles, king and son of Oedipus, marshals defenders gate by gate, deliberating with measured authority against each attacker's blazon and boast. The Chorus of Theban Women, terrified by the approaching army, oscillates between panic prayer and measured lamentation. When the Spy announces that Polyneices himself stands at the seventh gate, Eteocles recognizes that his father's curse compels him to face his brother. Both brothers die. The play ends with Antigone's defiant declaration that she will bury Polyneices despite the city's decree, and the chorus splits over the moral question.

## Six-Dimensional Analysis

### 1. The Chorus
The Chorus of Theban Women enters in a state of overwhelming terror -- "I wail in the stress of my terror, and shrill is my cry of despair. / The foemen roll forth from their camp as a billow, and onward they bear!" The parodos is formally remarkable: while it maintains strophe/antistrophe structure, the verse itself is emotionally saturated from the first syllable, the syntax rushing, the imagery of waves, dust, and thunder piling up beyond orderly description. In the middle episodes, the chorus is silenced and subordinated by Eteocles's authority -- reduced to brief chanted prayers between the Spy's reports and the king's measured responses. But in the final kommos and exodos, the chorus fractures: it splits into semi-choruses that disagree about whether to mourn Polyneices, mirroring at the formal level the civic and moral fracture the play has enacted.

**Position**: Mixed -- The parodos behaves as Dionysiac verse (emotionally flooding, rhythmically overwhelming), the mid-play chants are disciplined Apollonian responses, and the exodos enacts formal fracture as the chorus splits.

### 2. Individuation
Eteocles is one of the most sharply individuated heroes in Aeschylus. His opening speech is a model of deliberative rhetoric -- measured, authoritative, structured as civic address. The extended shield scene (the play's centerpiece) is a supreme display of Apollonian individuation: for each Argive champion, the Spy describes a blazon and boast, and Eteocles responds with forensic calm, dissecting the symbol and assigning a defender. His language maintains its rational, rhetorical structure through six matchings. But at the seventh gate, when Polyneices is named, Eteocles's individuation cracks: "Ah me, the madman, and the curse of Heaven / And woe for us, the lamentable line / Of Oedipus." The deliberative hero becomes the cursed son; rational agency yields to ancestral doom.

**Position**: Mixed -- Eteocles maintains extraordinary Apollonian individuation through the shield scene, but his self-knowledge at the seventh gate announces the dissolution of rational agency into inherited curse.

### 3. Suffering
The play is notable for how long it defers suffering. The entire shield scene -- the play's structural core -- is a formal postponement of violence through measured speech: the Spy reports, Eteocles deliberates, a champion is dispatched. Suffering is held at bay by the architecture of rational command. When it finally arrives (the brothers' mutual slaughter), it is reported offstage and narrated by a Messenger in composed, Apollonian form. But the choral lamentation that follows the report builds beyond composed narration into incantatory repetition: "O grievous the fate / That attends upon wrong / Stern ghost of our sire, / Thy vengeance is long! / Dark Fury of hell and of death, the hands of thy kingdom are strong!" This refrain repeats, the verse cycling through the same grief without resolution.

**Position**: Mixed -- Suffering is formally deferred and composed through the shield scene and messenger report, but the final lamentation exceeds composed form through incantatory repetition.

### 4. Resolution
The play offers a complex double ending. The Herald delivers an Apollonian civic verdict -- Eteocles honored, Polyneices cast out unburied -- which represents rational, institutional resolution: the city speaks through its laws. But Antigone immediately shatters this resolution: "I, I will bury this my brother's corse / And risk your wrath and what may come of it!" The stichomythia between Antigone and the Herald is formally balanced (line-for-line exchange), but its content is irreconcilable contradiction. The chorus then splits -- one half follows the civic decree, the other follows Antigone -- and the play ends in formal and moral fracture rather than resolution.

**Position**: Dionysiac -- The civic resolution is immediately contested and the dramatic form itself fractures, the chorus splitting into opposed semi-choruses that embody irreconcilable moral positions.

### 5. Language and Music
The play's dominant register is Apollonian: the Spy's reports are precise military intelligence, Eteocles's responses are forensic dissections of symbolic meaning, and the stichomythia is rigorously balanced. The shield scene is the most sustained passage of deliberative rhetoric in surviving tragedy -- each blazon is read as a text, each boast is answered with rational counter-argument. But the parodos operates in a wholly different register: "Hoof-trampled, the land of my love bears onward the din to mine ears. / As a torrent descending a mountain, it thunders and echoes and nears!" Here the verse behaves as sound itself -- rhythm and onomatopoeia dominate over argument. The closing lament likewise pushes language toward repetitive incantation.

**Position**: Mixed -- The shield scene is among the most sustained Apollonian rhetoric in tragedy, but the parodos and final lament push language into sound-dominated, incantatory territory.

### 6. Body and Boundaries
The brothers' mutual slaughter occurs offstage and is reported -- an Apollonian handling of violence through narrated image. The bodies are then brought onstage, and the formal boundary between inside and outside (the unseen battlefield and the visible civic space) is crossed. The key boundary violation, however, is categorical: the Herald's decree attempts to maintain the distinction between patriot and traitor, honored body and dishonored body. Antigone's defiance collapses this distinction -- brother is brother, regardless of civic category. The chorus's split dramatizes this boundary-violation at the formal level: the unified civic body divides.

**Position**: Mixed -- Violence is narrated with Apollonian composure, but the play's ending systematically violates categorical boundaries (civic/familial, honored/dishonored) as the chorus itself fractures.

## The Tension

### Where the poles collide
The collision is architectural. The shield scene -- the play's massive center -- is the most sustained display of Apollonian deliberative form in surviving tragedy: seven attackers, seven defenders, each matched through rational argument. It holds violence at bay through the sheer power of structured speech. But the seventh gate is the breaking point. When Eteocles recognizes his brother, the deliberative structure collapses into curse and doom, and the remainder of the play unfolds as progressive Dionysiac dissolution -- of the hero, of moral clarity, of choral unity.

### The dominant current
The Apollonian dominates by volume. The shield scene occupies the structural center and the majority of the play's lines. But the Dionysiac dominates by trajectory -- the play's movement is from order to fracture.

### Trajectory
From Apollonian deliberation toward Dionysiac dissolution. The play's arc can be read as the story of rational, individuated command confronting the one opponent it cannot master: the inherited curse, the familial doom that exceeds civic or rational containment.

### What the tension reveals
Seven Against Thebes stages the confrontation between civic reason (the Apollonian polis that organizes defense through measured speech) and ancestral curse (the Dionysiac undertow of the house of Oedipus). The shield scene is Aeschylus's most elaborate demonstration that language can order violence -- and the seventh gate is the moment when that demonstration fails. The play's formal fracture at the end (the split chorus, the irreconcilable moral positions) is the structural enactment of a truth the Apollonian frame cannot contain.

**Overall**: MIXTURE (Apollonian-dominant in structure, Dionysiac in trajectory)

### Classification Statement
Seven Against Thebes is built on the most sustained Apollonian formal structure in surviving tragedy -- the shield scene, in which Eteocles matches seven attackers with seven defenders through pure deliberative rhetoric, is an extraordinary demonstration of language's power to order violence. Yet the play is organized as a mechanism for the collapse of that very structure. When the seventh gate forces Eteocles to confront his own brother, the deliberative architecture gives way to ancestral curse, and the remainder of the play enacts progressive formal dissolution: the hero loses rational agency, the chorus splits, the civic resolution is immediately contested. The play's genius lies in the proportional weight it gives to the Apollonian edifice before allowing it to crack -- the formal order must be fully constructed before its destruction can have its devastating effect.

### Nietzsche's Own View
Nietzsche does not discuss Seven Against Thebes in detail in The Birth of Tragedy. His treatment of Aeschylus focuses primarily on Prometheus Bound and the Oresteia. However, the play's structure -- Apollonian form laboriously constructed, then shattered by forces it cannot contain -- perfectly illustrates Nietzsche's argument that the greatest tragedy exists in the tension between the two drives, where the Apollonian veil is thinnest.

## Textual Evidence

### Passage 1: Parodos (chorus entry)
**Classification**: Dionysiac
> "I wail in the stress of my terror, and shrill is my cry of despair. / The foemen roll forth from their camp as a billow, and onward they bear! / Their horsemen are swift in the forefront, the dust rises up to the sky, / A signal, though speechless, of doom, a herald more clear than a cry!"

**Why**: The verse itself behaves as panic -- syntax rushes, imagery cascades (billow, dust, sky), rhythm overwhelms deliberation. The chorus enters already in emotional extremity; the language does not describe fear so much as enact it formally.

---

### Passage 2: Eteocles responds to first attacker (shield scene)
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "To me, no blazon on a foeman's shield / Shall e'er present a fear! such pointed threats / Are powerless to wound; his plumes and bells, / Without a spear, are snakes without a sting. / Nay, more -- that pageant of which thou tellest -- / The nightly sky displayed, ablaze with stars, / Upon his shield, palters with double sense / One headstrong fool will find its truth anon!"

**Why**: Eteocles's language is forensic dissection -- he reads the blazon as a text, finds its ironic meaning, and dismisses it with measured contempt. The verse maintains rhetorical structure, argument builds logically, the hero's individuation is expressed as rational command over symbolic meaning.

---

### Passage 3: Eteocles at the seventh gate
**Classification**: Collision point
> "Ah me, the madman, and the curse of Heaven / And woe for us, the lamentable line / Of Oedipus, and woe that in this house / Our father's curse must find accomplishment! / But now, a truce to tears and loud lament, / Lest they should breed a still more rueful wail!"

**Why**: The deliberative hero's language cracks. "Ah me" is the cry of recognition that rational command has reached its limit. Yet Eteocles immediately tries to reassert Apollonian composure: "a truce to tears." The formal tension is visible in the verse itself -- grief erupts, then is suppressed, but the suppression no longer convinces.

---

### Passage 4: Chorus lament (repeated refrain)
**Classification**: Dionysiac
> "O grievous the fate / That attends upon wrong / Stern ghost of our sire, / Thy vengeance is long! / Dark Fury of hell and of death, the hands of thy kingdom are strong!"

**Why**: This refrain repeats through the final choral passages -- the verse cycles through the same grief without resolution, building through incantatory repetition. The language has abandoned interpretation for ritual invocation; it does not explain the curse but formally enacts its inescapable return.

---

### Passage 5: Antigone's defiance and the Herald's stichomythia
**Classification**: Collision point
> "ANTIGONE: His rights usurped, he answered wrong with wrong. / HERALD: Nay -- but for one man's sin he smote the State. / ANTIGONE: Contention doth out-talk all other gods! / Prate thou no more -- I will to bury him. / HERALD: Will, an thou wilt! but I forbid the deed."

**Why**: Formally, this is perfect Apollonian stichomythia -- balanced line-for-line exchange. But the content it carries is irreconcilable contradiction. The Apollonian form of dialogue is used to dramatize the impossibility of rational resolution. The form holds but its function (reaching consensus through argument) has been voided.

---

### Passage 6: Chorus splits (exodos)
**Classification**: Dionysiac
> "SEMI-CHORUS: Let those who hold our city's sway / Wreak, or forbear to wreak, their will / On those who cry, Ah, well-a-day! / Lamenting Polyneices still! / We will go forth and, side by side / With her, due burial will provide!"

**Why**: The unified choral body fractures into opposed semi-choruses -- one follows the civic decree, the other follows Antigone. The formal dissolution of the chorus into competing voices is the structural enactment of the play's refusal to resolve: the dramatic form itself splits.

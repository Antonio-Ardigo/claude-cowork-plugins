# Tragedy Classification: Prometheus Bound

## The Tragedy

**Title**: Prometheus Bound (*Prometheus Desmotes*)
**Playwright**: Aeschylus (525-456 BCE) -- authorship disputed by some scholars
**First performance**: c. 460 BCE
**Status**: Complete
**Mythological cycle**: Promethean (divine succession/rebellion)

### Synopsis
Prometheus, the Titan who stole fire for mankind, is chained to a remote crag in Scythia by Zeus's servants Kratos (Power) and Bia (Force), while Hephaestus reluctantly drives the nails. The Chorus of Oceanides arrives in a winged chariot to console him. Oceanus offers to intercede with Zeus but is refused. Prometheus delivers a great speech cataloging all the arts and sciences he gave to humanity. Io, driven mad by Zeus's desire and Hera's jealousy, wanders through in torment; Prometheus prophesies her future and his own eventual release. Hermes arrives demanding Prometheus reveal which marriage will overthrow Zeus; Prometheus refuses. The play ends with earthquake and thunder as Prometheus and the chorus are swallowed into the abyss.

## Six-Dimensional Analysis

### 1. The Chorus
The Chorus of Oceanides enters with sympathy but formal composure -- "Put thou all fear away! / In kindness cometh this array / On wings of speed to mountain lone." Their first stasimon is a beautiful, geographically expansive lament that maintains strophic balance while cataloging the regions that mourn Prometheus -- Asia, Colchis, Scythia, Arabia, Caucasus. The verse functions as measured, thematic interpretation: "Bellows the main of waters, surge with foam-seethed surge / Clashing tumultuous; for thee the deep seas chant their dirge." Through most of the play the chorus maintains its identity as sympathetic observers, offering gnomic counsel ("Thy sufferings have been shameful, and thy mind / Strays at a loss: like to a bad physician / Fallen sick"). But in the finale the chorus makes an extraordinary choice: refusing Hermes' command to abandon Prometheus, it declares "I will bear / With him all blows of fate" and is swallowed with him into the abyss. The chorus ceases to observe and becomes a participant in destruction.

**Position**: Mixed -- The chorus maintains measured, strophic, interpretive composure through most of the play, but its final act -- choosing to share Prometheus's destruction -- crosses from observation to participation, and the formal frame collapses.

### 2. Individuation
Prometheus is one of the most powerfully individuated figures in Greek tragedy. Pinned to a rock for the entire play, he is pure identity -- immobile, unbending, defined by his refusal. His great catalog speech (arts, sciences, medicine, divination given to man) is Apollonian self-presentation at its most sustained: a rational inventory delivered in controlled, encyclopedic prose. His prophecy to Io is similarly composed -- visually precise, geographically ordered, sequentially narrated. He maintains forensic command of every dialogue. Yet this hyper-individuation is paradoxical: Prometheus cannot move, cannot act, cannot change. His identity is so absolute it becomes a kind of rigidity that borders on the inhuman. In the finale, his defiance ("Let curled lightnings clasp and clash / And close upon my limbs") pushes language into a register that exceeds deliberation -- it becomes invocation of his own annihilation.

**Position**: Apollonian (strong) -- Prometheus is perhaps the most individuated hero in tragedy, maintaining rational, rhetorical command of every exchange, though the finale strains toward Dionysiac self-dissolution.

### 3. Suffering
Prometheus's suffering is extraordinary in its formal treatment: it is both continuously present (he is visibly chained and in pain throughout) and continuously narrated with composure. Hephaestus describes the coming torment in measured, pitying verse: "the sun-blaze shall roast / Thy flesh; thy hue, flower-fair, shall suffer change." Hermes' description of the eagle is similarly composed: "The hound of Zeus, the tawny eagle, / Shall violently fall upon thy flesh / And rend it as 'twere rags; and every day / And all day long shall thine unbidden guest / Sit at thy table, feasting on thy liver / Till he hath gnawn it black." This is horrific content delivered in Apollonian form -- the verse maintains its composure while describing perpetual bodily violation. Io's suffering, by contrast, is formally Dionysiac: she enters as a figure whose body and mind have been shattered by divine violence, her speech fragmented and desperate.

**Position**: Mixed -- Prometheus's suffering is expressed through masterfully composed narration (Apollonian), but Io's entrance introduces formally Dionysiac suffering -- bodily, fragmented, beyond rational containment.

### 4. Resolution
The play has no resolution. Prometheus refuses to yield; Zeus does not relent. The final scene is pure catastrophe: earthquake, thunder, and the protagonist swallowed into an abyss along with the chorus. The last words are Prometheus's invocation: "Earth, awful Mother! Air, / That shedd'st from the revolving sky / On all the light they see thee by, / What bitter wrongs I bear!" This is not closure but rupture -- the dramatic form is physically destroyed as the stage collapses. Even Hermes' warning that the catastrophe is self-chosen ("Ye labour for your fall / With your own hands!") provides no moral resolution, only the assertion that defiance has consequences.

**Position**: Dionysiac (strong) -- The play ends not with resolution but with the literal destruction of the dramatic space; the form itself is swallowed.

### 5. Language and Music
The play's dominant register is Apollonian: long, structured speeches of extraordinary rhetorical command. Prometheus's catalog of gifts to humanity (lines ~1098-1161) is forensic prose at its most sustained -- rational, sequential, encyclopedic. His prophecy to Io is similarly composed: a precise geographical itinerary delivered with visionary clarity. The stichomythia exchanges (Prometheus/Io, Prometheus/Hermes) are formally balanced. Yet the finale shifts register dramatically. Prometheus's last speech -- "Let curled lightnings clasp and clash / And close upon my limbs: loud crash / The thunder, and fierce throes / Of savage winds convulse calm air" -- abandons deliberative speech for lyric that enacts the cosmic violence it describes. Hermes identifies this as "The vein / Of voluble ecstasy" -- language that has exceeded its rational function.

**Position**: Mixed -- The dominant register is composed, rhetorical, forensic speech of extraordinary sustained power, but the finale pushes into ecstatic lyric that Hermes himself calls "ecstasy."

### 6. Body and Boundaries
The entire play is organized around the spectacle of a bound body -- Prometheus's flesh is hammered, nailed, and exposed for the duration. Yet this bodily violence is handled with remarkable formal composure: the nailing is described rather than graphically enacted, and Prometheus's physical suffering is expressed through dignified speech rather than cries. The body is present as image, not as overwhelmed flesh. The boundary between divine and human is the play's central thematic concern -- Prometheus bridges it, and Zeus punishes the transgression. The cosmic destruction of the finale, however, collapses all spatial boundaries: earth splits, sky breaks, the chasm swallows stage, actor, and chorus together. The dramatic space itself is destroyed.

**Position**: Mixed -- The bound body is maintained as a composed visual image (Apollonian), but the finale destroys all boundaries -- spatial, dramatic, cosmic -- as the stage is swallowed.

## The Tension

### Where the poles collide
The collision is between Prometheus's extraordinary Apollonian self-possession -- his rational command, his composed speech, his unbending identity -- and the Dionysiac forces that surround and ultimately engulf him. The play stages an Apollonian consciousness trapped in a Dionysiac cosmos: a hero who maintains perfect rational clarity while the universe conspires to destroy him.

### The dominant current
Apollonian in voice, Dionysiac in structure. Prometheus's language is among the most sustained rational rhetoric in tragedy. But the dramatic architecture -- a hero nailed in place who cannot change, surrounded by figures of suffering (Io) and coercion (Kratos, Hermes), with no resolution possible -- is fundamentally Dionysiac: it refuses closure, refuses moral intelligibility, and ends in cosmic destruction.

### Trajectory
Unlike most tragedies, which move from one pole toward the other, Prometheus Bound maintains a static tension until the finale, when the Dionysiac erupts catastrophically. The trajectory is not gradual but explosive: five acts of sustained Apollonian rhetoric, then a cataclysm.

### What the tension reveals
Nietzsche identified Prometheus as a key figure for understanding the Apollonian-Dionysiac dialectic. The play stages what happens when Apollonian individuation is pushed to its absolute limit -- when the hero is so rigidly defined, so completely himself, that he becomes a fixed point around which cosmic violence rotates. The finale reveals that even the most powerful Apollonian form cannot hold indefinitely against the Dionysiac abyss.

**Overall**: MIXTURE (Apollonian voice within Dionysiac structure)

### Classification Statement
Prometheus Bound is a tragedy of sustained Apollonian defiance within a Dionysiac cosmos. Prometheus's speeches -- his catalog of gifts to humanity, his prophecy to Io, his forensic exchanges with every visitor -- represent some of the most controlled, rational, rhetorically masterful language in surviving tragedy. His individuation is absolute: he never wavers, never fragments, never dissolves. Yet the dramatic structure in which this Apollonian consciousness is imprisoned is profoundly Dionysiac: it offers no resolution, no moral closure, no *pathei mathos*. The play ends with the literal destruction of the dramatic space as earthquake swallows actor and chorus into the abyss. The tension between Prometheus's composed voice and the cosmos that destroys him is the play's central aesthetic achievement -- the Apollonian has never been more eloquent, and the Dionysiac has never been more absolute.

### Nietzsche's Own View
In *The Birth of Tragedy* (sec. 9), Nietzsche treats Prometheus as the supreme Apollonian tragic hero -- the "Titanic artist" who creates civilization through an act of sacrilege against the gods. Nietzsche reads the myth as illustrating "the Apollonian tendency to freeze all individual forms in rigid Egyptian coldness" -- Prometheus's unbending defiance is the Apollonian principle pushed to its extreme. Yet Nietzsche also recognizes that Prometheus's rebellion against Zeus carries Dionysiac energy -- the transgression against divine order that is necessary for creation. Nietzsche sees in the Prometheus myth the "profound Aeschylean demand for justice": the insight that creation requires destruction, that individuation necessarily involves violation of the primal unity. The present analysis aligns with Nietzsche's reading while emphasizing that the play's *dramatic form* -- not just its myth -- enacts this tension between Apollonian voice and Dionysiac structure.

## Textual Evidence

### Passage 1: Prometheus's catalog of gifts to humanity
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "In the beginning, seeing they saw amiss, / And hearing heard not, but, like phantoms huddled / In dreams, the perplexed story of their days / Confounded; knowing neither timber-work / Nor brick-built dwellings basking in the light, / But dug for themselves holes, wherein like ants, / That hardly may contend against a breath, / They dwelt in burrows of their unsunned caves."

**Why**: This is forensic, encyclopedic prose of extraordinary sustained power -- rational, sequential, composed. The verse serves its descriptive and argumentative function with complete rhetorical discipline. Prometheus's identity as civilizing intelligence is expressed through the most measured language in the play.

---

### Passage 2: Chorus first stasimon (lament for Prometheus)
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "Bellows the main of waters, surge with foam-seethed surge / Clashing tumultuous; for thee the deep seas chant their dirge; / And Hell's dark under-world a hollow moaning fills; / Thee mourn the sacred streams with all their fountain-rills."

**Why**: The content is cosmic grief -- seas, underworld, rivers all mourning. But the verse maintains strophic balance and measured syntax. The chorus interprets and describes rather than enacts; the language serves its thematic function. This is Apollonian verse carrying tremendous emotional weight without losing formal composure.

---

### Passage 3: Prometheus's first soliloquy after binding
**Classification**: Collision point
> "Ha! Ha! / What echo, what odour floats by with no sound? / God-wafted or mortal or mingled its strain? / Comes there one to this world's end, this mountain-girt ground, / To have sight of my torment? Or of what is he fain? / A God ye behold in bondage and pain"

**Why**: The shift from Prometheus's earlier composed speech to "Ha! Ha!" and the short, rhythmically driven questions marks a formal rupture. The verse contracts, the syntax fragments into rapid questions, the rhythm accelerates. This is the collision point where Apollonian rhetorical command momentarily gives way to something more urgent and rhythmically driven.

---

### Passage 4: Prometheus's final defiance
**Classification**: Dionysiac
> "Let curled lightnings clasp and clash / And close upon my limbs: loud crash / The thunder, and fierce throes / Of savage winds convulse calm air: / The embowelled blast earth's roots uptear / And toss beyond its bars, / The rough surge, till the roaring deep / In one devouring deluge sweep / The pathway of the stars"

**Why**: This is no longer deliberative speech. The verse has become incantatory invocation of cosmic destruction -- rhythm and sound dominate over argument. "Let... let... let" -- the imperatives summon annihilation. Hermes himself identifies this as "the vein of voluble ecstasy." The language exceeds its rational function and becomes a ritual summoning of the hero's own engulfment.

---

### Passage 5: Chorus refuses to abandon Prometheus
**Classification**: Collision point
> "Words which might work persuasion speak / If thou must counsel me; nor seek / Thus, like a stream in spate, / To uproot mine honour. Dost thou dare / Urge me to baseness! I will bear / With him all blows of fate; / For false forsakers I despise; / At treachery my gorge doth rise: / I spew it forth with hate!"

**Why**: The chorus's language maintains formal discipline -- strophic structure, balanced syntax, gnomic declaration. But the content is a decision to abandon the observer's position and share Prometheus's destruction. The Apollonian form is used to announce a Dionysiac act: the chorus crosses from frame to participation, from commentary to self-annihilation. This is the moment where the choral body joins the hero's fate.

---

### Passage 6: Stage direction -- the cataclysm
**Classification**: Dionysiac
> "Earth, awful Mother! Air, / That shedd'st from the revolving sky / On all the light they see thee by, / What bitter wrongs I bear! / *The scene closes with earthquake and thunder, in the midst of which PROMETHEUS and the DAUGHTERS OF OCEANUS sink into the abyss.*"

**Why**: The dramatic form itself is destroyed. The stage literally collapses. Actor and chorus are swallowed together into the earth -- all boundaries between performance space and abyss, between actor and chorus, between dramatic present and cosmic destruction, are annihilated. This is the most extreme Dionysiac ending in surviving tragedy: not just an open wound in the form, but the obliteration of the form itself.

# Tragedy Classification: Oedipus at Colonus

## The Tragedy

**Title**: Oedipus at Colonus (*Oedipus epi Kolono*)
**Playwright**: Sophocles (c. 496-406 BCE)
**First performance**: 401 BCE (posthumous)
**Status**: Complete
**Mythological cycle**: Theban (the final journey of Oedipus, the curse on his sons)

### Synopsis
The blind, aged Oedipus, led by his daughter Antigone, arrives at Colonus near Athens and sits in the sacred grove of the Eumenides. He recognizes this as the place foretold by Apollo where he will die and become a blessing to the land that receives him. The Chorus of Elders first recoils at his name but is moved by Antigone's plea. Ismene arrives with news that Thebes seeks Oedipus for its protection. Theseus, king of Athens, offers him sanctuary. Creon arrives with force to seize Oedipus and abducts Antigone and Ismene, but Theseus rescues them. Polyneices comes to beg his father's support for his war against Thebes; Oedipus curses both sons to die by each other's hand. Thunder sounds -- the sign of Oedipus's appointed end. He leads the way (the blind guiding the sighted) to a hidden spot where, witnessed only by Theseus, he passes from the world in a mysterious departure without pain or violence. The Messenger reports what no narration can fully contain, and Antigone's grief is tempered by the knowledge that Oedipus's death was unlike any mortal's.

## Six-Dimensional Analysis

### 1. The Chorus
The Chorus of Elders of Colonus maintains civic, deliberative function throughout. The parodos is a formal investigation: "Ha! Where is he? Look around! / Every nook and corner scan!" -- the chorus searches, questions, deliberates. The famous Colonus ode ("Thou hast come to a steed-famed land for rest, / O stranger worn with toil") is the most beautiful Apollonian lyric in Sophocles: strophe-antistrophe maintained with flawless discipline, each image composed with painterly precision -- the nightingale in her wine-dark ivy bower, the narcissi fed by pearly dew, the grey-leaved olive, the might of horses and the sea. This ode does not reason or debate; it celebrates, but the celebration is measured, strophic, imagistically controlled. The battle ode ("O when the flying foe, / Turning at last to bay") is composed martial hymn, invoking Zeus, Athena, Apollo, and Artemis in formal sequence. The chorus functions as the voice of Athenian civic order, defending the suppliant through rational argument and sacred law.

**Position**: Apollonian -- The chorus maintains formal discipline and civic function throughout. The Colonus ode is the supreme Apollonian lyric in Sophocles: measured, strophic, imagistically composed, celebrating the beauty of place and divine order.

### 2. Individuation
Oedipus is the most extraordinarily individuated figure in all of Sophocles' surviving work -- not despite his suffering but through it. The blind exile maintains sovereign moral authority from the first line: "I am taught by suffering to endure, / And the long years that have grown old with me, / And last not least, by true nobility." His defense speech against Creon is devastating forensic rhetoric: "Come, answer me one question, if thou canst: / If one should presently attempt thy life, / Would'st thou, O man of justice, first inquire / If the assassin was perchance thy sire, / Or turn upon him?" His curse on Polyneices is the most terrible exercise of paternal authority in Greek tragedy. Throughout, Oedipus speaks with the measured force of one who has moved through suffering to an authority that exceeds rational explanation. His final act -- leading the sighted to the place of his death, the blind man guiding those who see -- is the supreme assertion of individuation: he commands his own passing. Theseus is individuated as the model of rational, compassionate sovereignty: "Nothing save my death / Will stay my purpose to restore the maids."

**Position**: Apollonian -- Oedipus maintains the most sustained and intense individuation in Sophocles. His selfhood is not dissolved by suffering but refined by it; his authority grows as his physical powers diminish. His death is willed, sovereign, self-directed.

### 3. Suffering
The play's handling of suffering is unique in Greek tragedy. Oedipus's suffering is past -- endured, survived, and transmuted into authority. The play does not stage the catastrophe (as in Oedipus Rex) but presents the figure who has lived through catastrophe and emerged with mysterious power. When the Chorus presses him to recount his history, the exchange is formally remarkable: "Know then I suffered ills most vile, but none / (So help me Heaven!) from acts in malice done." The suffering is acknowledged but contained within forensic argument -- Oedipus defends himself with rational precision against the charge that his deeds were willed. The Messenger's report of Oedipus's death is the most formally extraordinary in Greek tragedy: no violence, no bodily destruction, no agonized cries. Thunder sounds, a divine voice calls, and Oedipus passes from the world in a manner the Messenger acknowledges he cannot fully narrate -- "a passing more than mortal, wonderful." The convention of Apollonian narrative reportage is pushed beyond its capacity: the Messenger reports a mystery that exceeds what narration can contain.

**Position**: Mixed -- Suffering has been endured and transmuted rather than staged; the Messenger's report of death pushes Apollonian narration toward a mystery it cannot fully articulate -- not Dionysiac dissolution but something that exceeds the Apollonian framework while maintaining its formal composure.

### 4. Resolution
The play achieves the most complete resolution in Sophocles. The oracle is fulfilled: Oedipus reaches the appointed place and receives the appointed death. Athens gains a protecting hero. Theseus's sovereignty is vindicated. The sacred law of hospitality triumphs over Creon's force. Yet this resolution transcends civic deliberation. Oedipus's transformation from polluted exile to protective hero-cult is not a rational outcome but a sacred mystery: only Theseus knows the secret of the burial place, and what happened at the final moment is beyond mortal telling. The resolution is real -- the play does not leave its moral questions open -- but it operates at the boundary between human comprehension and divine mystery. The curse on Polyneices and Eteocles, which seeds the Theban catastrophe to come, coexists with the blessed death: resolution and continuing doom are simultaneous.

**Position**: Mixed -- Genuine resolution is achieved (oracle fulfilled, hero established, Athens blessed), but the resolution transcends rational comprehension. The sacred mystery of Oedipus's passing exceeds what civic deliberation or moral reasoning can explain.

### 5. Language and Music
The play's dominant register is forensic rhetoric of the highest order. Oedipus's speeches are among Sophocles' finest: the defense against the Chorus ("deeds of a man more sinned against than sinning"), the devastating counter-argument to Creon, the terrible curse on Polyneices. The stichomythia is measured and balanced throughout -- Oedipus with the Stranger, with the Chorus, with Ismene, with Creon. Theseus speaks with the composed authority of the ideal rational ruler. The Colonus ode operates in the purest Apollonian lyric register: each image is composed ("the wine-dark ivy that wreathes the vale," "the grey-leaved olive that feeds our boys"), each strophic pair balanced, each divine name placed in its proper sequence. The battle ode is martial hymn in formal discipline. Only at the very end, in the final kommos, does language press toward lamentation -- and even there, the grief is tempered by the knowledge that this death was blessed.

**Position**: Apollonian -- The play's language is overwhelmingly forensic, deliberative, and lyrically composed. The Colonus ode is the supreme Apollonian lyric in Sophocles. Even lamentation is measured and contained.

### 6. Body and Boundaries
Oedipus's body is the play's central problem and its central mystery. He arrives as the polluted exile -- his body a source of ritual contamination, his presence in the sacred grove a trespass. The entire first movement of the play concerns the question of whether his body may remain. But this polluted body is also the future source of blessing: the oracle promises that where Oedipus is buried, the land will be protected. The play traces the transformation of the body from pollution to sacred power. Oedipus's death is the crossing of the ultimate boundary -- mortal to immortal, visible to invisible -- and it occurs not through violence or dissolution but through a mysterious departure. The body is not torn apart (Dionysiac sparagmos) but simply passes from the world. The sacred grove itself is a boundary-space: the threshold between the human city and the realm of the Eumenides, the "Gracious Ones," chthonic powers who dwell beneath the earth. Oedipus sits at this threshold and crosses it. Creon's attempt to seize Oedipus's body by force is the violation that Theseus (civic law) repels; the body's final disposition is sacred, hidden, known only to the king.

**Position**: Mixed -- The body crosses the ultimate boundary (mortal to immortal), but the crossing is not violent dissolution; it is sacred transformation. The polluted body becomes the protective hero's body -- boundary-crossing as consecration rather than destruction.

## The Tension

### Where the poles collide
The collision is subtle and occurs at the play's deepest structural level: the Apollonian form of the play (forensic rhetoric, civic deliberation, composed lyric, measured stichomythia) is used to contain and convey a content that finally exceeds rational explanation. Oedipus's authority -- moral, rhetorical, forensic -- grows throughout the play, but its source is not reason; it is the suffering that has passed through reason and emerged on the other side. The Messenger's report of the death is the formal crux: Apollonian narrative convention is maintained, but what is narrated is a mystery that the narrator himself cannot comprehend. The convention holds; the content transcends it.

### The dominant current
The Apollonian dominates overwhelmingly. The play is Sophocles' most sustained demonstration of forensic rhetoric, civic deliberation, and Apollonian lyric beauty. Oedipus's individuation is the most intense in the surviving corpus. The Colonus ode is the most beautiful composed lyric in Greek tragedy. The resolution is genuine and complete.

### Trajectory
From exile toward consecration, from pollution toward blessing, from suffering toward mysterious authority. The play's arc is the opposite of Oedipus Rex: where the earlier play traces the dissolution of the sovereign individual through self-knowledge, this play traces the establishment of the suffering individual as sacred power. The trajectory is toward resolution, not dissolution.

### What the tension reveals
Oedipus at Colonus stages the relationship between suffering and wisdom not as the Apollonian formula "learning through suffering" (pathei mathos) but as something that exceeds that formula: the suffering individual becomes a source of power that cannot be rationally explained. The play's Apollonian form -- its forensic rhetoric, its civic framework, its composed beauty -- serves as the vessel for a content that finally points beyond the Apollonian: the mystery of how the most polluted becomes the most sacred, how the blind man sees most clearly, how the exile becomes the protector. This is not Dionysiac dissolution but neither is it Apollonian rational comprehension; it is the Apollonian form stretched to its furthest reach, containing what it cannot fully explain.

### Classification Statement
Oedipus at Colonus is among the most Apollonian plays in the corpus, rivaling Ajax in the sustained dominance of forensic rhetoric, civic deliberation, and composed lyric beauty. Oedipus's individuation is the most intense and sustained in Sophocles' surviving work; his forensic speeches are among the playwright's finest; the Colonus ode is the supreme Apollonian lyric in Greek tragedy. The resolution is genuine and complete: oracle fulfilled, hero established, Athens blessed. Yet the play is not purely Apollonian because its deepest content -- the mystery of Oedipus's transformation from polluted exile to sacred protector -- exceeds what rational comprehension can explain. The Messenger's report of the death pushes Apollonian narrative convention toward a mystery it acknowledges it cannot fully articulate. The play's genius is that it maintains Apollonian form with perfect composure while pointing, at its climactic moment, toward a truth that the form can contain but not explain: the passing of the individual not into Dionysiac dissolution but into a sacred reality that transcends the boundary between mortal and divine.

### Nietzsche's Own View
Nietzsche discusses Oedipus at Colonus briefly but significantly in The Birth of Tragedy (sec. 9), where he identifies the play's ending as the supreme instance of "Apollonian transfiguration." For Nietzsche, Oedipus's mysterious death represents the moment when the Apollonian veil is thinnest: the suffering individual, having endured the Dionysiac truth revealed in the earlier play, achieves a form of reconciliation that is not rational comprehension but a "higher form of activity" -- a "supernatural cheerfulness" that comes after the worst has been seen and survived. Nietzsche reads the play as Sophocles' demonstration that the Apollonian principle, when it has genuinely absorbed the Dionysiac truth, can achieve not mere beautiful illusion but a "metaphysical comfort" that points beyond both principles toward the unity that underlies them.

## Textual Evidence

### Passage 1: Oedipus's opening address
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "I am taught by suffering to endure, / And the long years that have grown old with me, / And last not least, by true nobility."

**Why**: The speech is measured, gnomic, syntactically controlled. Oedipus names the three sources of his composure -- suffering, time, nobility -- with the precision of a philosopher cataloging virtues. The principium individuationis is fully intact; the suffering individual speaks with sovereign authority derived from the very experience that destroyed him in the earlier play. This is Apollonian self-possession achieved through, not despite, extremity.

### Passage 2: The Colonus ode
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "Thou hast come to a steed-famed land for rest, / O stranger worn with toil, / To a land of all lands the goodliest / Colonus' glistening soil. / 'Tis the haunt of the clear-voiced nightingale, / Who hid in her bower, among / The wine-dark ivy that wreathes the vale, / Trilleth her ceaseless song."

**Why**: The supreme Apollonian lyric in Sophocles. Every image is composed with painterly precision: nightingale, wine-dark ivy, narcissi, crocus, olive, horse, sea. Strophe-antistrophe structure is maintained with flawless discipline. The ode celebrates the beauty of place as the beauty of divine order -- each god named in sequence (Dionysus, Demeter, Persephone, Cephisus, the Muses, Aphrodite, Athena, Poseidon), each landscape feature rendered with composed clarity. This is the Apollonian dream-image at its most luminous.

### Passage 3: Oedipus's defense against the Chorus
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "Yet am I then / A villain born because in self-defense, / Striken, I struck the striker back again? / E'en had I known, no villainy 'twould prove: / But all unwitting whither I went, I went-- / To ruin; my destroyers knew it well."

**Why**: Forensic rhetoric of the highest order: the argument is structured as a hypothetical legal defense (if attacked, would you not strike back?), moving from premise to conclusion with logical force. Oedipus maintains his moral case through composed deliberation, distinguishing intention from action, knowledge from ignorance. The principium individuationis is expressed as rational self-advocacy: the suffering man defends himself with the tools of Apollonian reason.

### Passage 4: The Chorus probes Oedipus's past (lyric exchange)
**Classification**: Collision point
> "OEDIPUS: Know then I suffered ills most vile, but none / (So help me Heaven!) from acts in malice done. / CHORUS: Say how. / OEDIPUS: The State around / An all unwitting bridegroom bound / An impious marriage chain; / That was my bane."

**Why**: The lyric exchange (kommos) uses the formal structure of strophic question-and-answer to extract the Dionysiac content of Oedipus's history: incest, parricide, the collapse of generational and sexual boundaries. The form is Apollonian (strophe-antistrophe maintained, each question formally balanced), but the content it carries is the same Dionysiac truth that shattered the earlier play. The difference is that here the content has been endured and is now recounted within formal composure -- the Apollonian form contains the Dionysiac truth without being destroyed by it.

---

### Passage 5: Theseus's declaration of protection
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "Stay here assured that nothing save my death / Will stay my purpose to restore the maids... / Having come / Unto a State that champions right and asks / For every action warranty of law, / Thou hast set aside the custom of the land."

**Why**: The purest Apollonian civic speech in the play: Theseus speaks as the ideal rational sovereign, defending sacred law, hospitality, and civic justice through composed deliberation. His authority is institutional, not personal; his argument proceeds from principle to application. This is the Apollonian polis functioning at its highest: the State as guarantor of sacred order through rational governance.

---

### Passage 6: The Chorus's battle prayer
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "All-seeing Zeus, O lord of heaven, / To our guardian host be given / Might triumphant to surprise / Flying foes and win their prize. / Hear us, Zeus, and hear us, child / Of Zeus, Athene undefiled, / Hear, Apollo, hunter, hear, / Huntress, sister of Apollo."

**Why**: Formally disciplined hymnic prayer: each deity invoked in proper sequence, each line metrically balanced, the strophic structure maintained with precision. The chorus calls on the gods as civic protectors, and the prayer functions as ritual civic speech -- the community addressing its divine guardians in measured, formal, composed verse. Even in the urgency of the battle, the Apollonian choral discipline holds.

# Tragedy Classification: The Persians

## The Tragedy

**Title**: The Persians (*Persai*)
**Playwright**: Aeschylus (525-456 BCE)
**First performance**: c. 472 BCE
**Status**: Complete
**Mythological cycle**: Historical -- the only surviving Greek tragedy based on real events (Battle of Salamis, 480 BCE)

### Synopsis
The Persian Elders wait at Susa for news of Xerxes' expedition against Greece. Queen Atossa, troubled by ominous dreams, enters and learns from a Messenger that the Persian fleet has been destroyed at Salamis and the army shattered in retreat. The chorus and Atossa summon the Ghost of Darius from his tomb; Darius condemns his son's hubris and prophesies further disaster at Plataea. Xerxes himself finally arrives in rags, and the play closes with an extended kommos of antiphonal lamentation between the ruined king and his elders.

## Six-Dimensional Analysis

### 1. The Chorus
The Chorus of Persian Elders opens the play with an expansive parodos that catalogs the armies of Persia in a formally measured, processional manner -- name after name, regiment after regiment, in balanced strophic pairs. This is a civic body defined by institutional standing, speaking from authority grounded in rank and service. Through the middle sections, the chorus maintains strophic discipline in the odes lamenting Persia's losses. However, the final movement transforms the chorus utterly. In the extended kommos with Xerxes, the choral voice fragments into short, antiphonal cries -- "Wo, wo!" "Few, very few." "I see, I see." -- and the elders are commanded to rend their robes, tear their beards, and beat their breasts. The verse becomes incantatory repetition, and the formal separation between chorus and actor dissolves into shared ritual lamentation.

**Position**: Mixed -- The chorus begins as a paradigmatic Apollonian civic body maintaining strophic measure, but its verse dissolves into ecstatic, formally fragmenting lamentation in the exodos.

### 2. Individuation
Xerxes is never fully realized as an individuated tragic hero. He appears only in the final scene with no deliberative speech, no forensic argument, no moment of rational self-examination -- his identity already dissolved by catastrophe. Darius, by contrast, appears as a sharply defined individual with a distinct moral posture and coherent worldview. His ghost speech is the most individuated moment: clear, measured, morally authoritative. Atossa likewise maintains bounded selfhood throughout, narrating her dream with visual precision and navigating catastrophe with composed dignity.

**Position**: Mixed -- Darius and Atossa are sharply individuated with forensic, self-possessed language; Xerxes arrives already shattered, without bounded selfhood or deliberative agency.

### 3. Suffering
The suffering is narrated at enormous length through one of the most elaborate messenger speeches in extant tragedy. The Messenger's account of Salamis is a paradigm of Apollonian composed narration -- horrific events rendered in visual, sequential, rhetorically structured prose. Yet the sheer accumulation -- the catalog of the dead, the retreat through Thrace, the drowning in the Strymon -- begins to exceed what any single narration can contain. In the final kommos, suffering escapes narration entirely and becomes enacted ritual: Xerxes demands the chorus beat their breasts, rend their robes, tear their hair. Suffering moves from image to body, from speech to cry.

**Position**: Mixed -- The messenger speech composes suffering into masterfully formed narration, but the final movement abandons narration for enacted, bodily, ritually excessive grief.

### 4. Resolution
The Ghost of Darius provides the play's moral center: Xerxes' hubris in bridging the Hellespont has called down divine punishment; mortals must not aspire beyond their measure. This is clear *pathei mathos* -- wisdom through suffering -- delivered with gnomic authority. The moral architecture is Apollonian: transgression, punishment, intelligible divine justice. Yet the play does not end here. What follows is not resolution but dissolution -- the kommos with Xerxes, which offers no wisdom, no restoration, no return to order. The play ends mid-wail, with the chorus leading the broken king offstage. The moral clarity of Darius's speech is structurally overwhelmed by the emotional devastation that follows it.

**Position**: Mixed -- Darius delivers Apollonian moral resolution, but the play's actual ending refuses to rest there, dissolving into unresolved ritual lamentation.

### 5. Language and Music
The play's dominant register -- the parodos catalog, the stichomythia between Atossa and the Leader, the messenger speech, the Darius scene -- is composed in measured, rhetorically structured verse. The stichomythia exchanges are models of Apollonian formal discipline. But the necromancy scene builds through ritual repetition -- "Rise then, sovereign lord, to light" / "Great and good, Darius, rise" -- the verse behaving as invocation rather than description. And the exodos pushes language toward pure sound: "Wo, wo, wo! Unutterable wo" -- a line that acknowledges the failure of language to contain what it must express.

**Position**: Mixed -- The play's dominant register is composed and visually precise, but the necromancy and exodos push language into incantatory and musically dominated territory.

### 6. Body and Boundaries
The Apollonian body is maintained throughout most of the play -- Atossa enters in royal splendor, Darius rises in regal state, the dead are narrated rather than shown. The messenger's account of bodily destruction is formally composed: terrible images rendered as painterly tableaux. However, the final movement is a systematic assault on the body's integrity. Xerxes enters with robes already rent, displays his empty quiver, then commands the chorus to perform acts of bodily self-violation: "beat thy breast, / Strike, heave the groan... rend thy rich robes, / Pluck up thy beard, tear off thy hoary locks." The royal body is publicly shredded -- not narrated violence but enacted sparagmos.

**Position**: Dionysiac -- While most bodily destruction is narrated with composure, the climactic action is the enacted, ritualized dismantling of the king's body on stage, a formal sparagmos.

## The Tension

### Where the poles collide
The decisive collision point is the transition from the Darius scene to the Xerxes kommos. Darius's ghost delivers the most Apollonian speech in the play -- measured, morally authoritative, gnomic in its wisdom -- and then descends. What follows is the most Dionysiac passage Aeschylus ever wrote: a shattered king commanding his own elders to join him in ecstatic, formless lamentation.

### The dominant current
The Apollonian dominates the play's architecture. The parodos catalog, the stichomythia, the messenger speech, and the Darius scene are all formally masterful instances of composed, individuated, morally coherent dramatic art. In sheer volume, the Apollonian voice carries the majority of the text.

### Trajectory
The play moves from Apollonian form toward Dionysiac dissolution. It begins with the most formally ordered of all choral openings -- a processional catalog of military might -- and ends with collective wailing. The trajectory is a descent from imperial order into ritual chaos, enacted in the formal behavior of the verse itself.

### What the tension reveals
The Persians dramatizes the Apollonian conviction that suffering can be made intelligible through form -- and then tests that conviction to destruction. The messenger speech proves that horror can be narrated. Darius proves that catastrophe can be moralized. But the play's final movement suggests that some grief exceeds what narration and moralization can contain. The kommos is the moment when Apollonian form acknowledges its own insufficiency and yields to the Dionysiac cry.

**Overall**: MIXTURE (Apollonian-dominant)

### Classification Statement
The Persians is a tragedy structured by Apollonian formal mastery -- its catalog parodos, stichomythic exchanges, composed messenger speech, and the Ghost of Darius's gnomic moral authority represent some of the most disciplined dramatic art in the surviving corpus. Yet the play's trajectory moves inexorably from this Apollonian architecture toward Dionysiac dissolution. The final kommos, in which Xerxes and the chorus enact a ritual lamentation that shatters the formal boundaries between actor and chorus, speech and song, composed grief and bodily self-violation, reveals that the play has been organized all along as a structure designed to give way. The Apollonian frame does not merely contain the Dionysiac; it builds toward its own collapse, and the play's devastating effect depends on the audience having experienced the full measure of composed form before that form is overwhelmed.

### Nietzsche's Own View
Nietzsche does not devote sustained analysis to The Persians in The Birth of Tragedy. His Aeschylean focus falls primarily on the Oresteia and Prometheus Bound. However, Nietzsche's general claim that Aeschylus most strongly maintains the principium individuationis and moral intelligibility is consistent with the play's dominant register. He would likely have recognized the final kommos as an eruption of the Dionysiac dithyrambic origin of tragedy breaking through the Apollonian dramatic surface.

## Textual Evidence

### Passage 1: Parodos (opening strophe)
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "Already o'er the adverse strand / In arms the monarch's martial squadrons spread; / The threat'ning ruin shakes the land, / And each tall city bows its tower'd head. / Bark bound to bark, their wondrous way / They bridge across the indignant sea"

**Why**: The chorus at its most Apollonian: composed, balanced strophe, visually precise imagery, the verse maintaining formal measure. The strophe-antistrophe structure is rigorously maintained while cataloging imperial power.

---

### Passage 2: Messenger speech (Battle of Salamis)
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "The morn, all beauteous to behold, / Drawn by white steeds bounds o'er the enlighten'd earth; / At once from ev'ry Greek with glad acclaim / Burst forth the song of war, whose lofty notes / The echo of the island rocks return'd, / Spreading dismay through Persia's hosts"

**Why**: The supreme Apollonian form: offstage horror narrated as a composed, sequential, visually precise image. The language maintains its rhetorical structure, rendering chaos as order. Even the battle-cry is narrated rather than reproduced.

---

### Passage 3: Necromancy invocation of Darius
**Classification**: Collision point
> "Rise then, sovereign lord, to light; / On this mound's sepulchral height / Lift thy sock in saffron died, / And rear thy rich tiara's regal pride! / Great and good, Darius, rise: / Lord of Persia's lord, appear: / Thus involved with thrilling cries / Come, our tale of sorrow hear!"

**Why**: The strophic structure formally holds, but the verse's spirit has shifted. The language is incantatory -- "Rise... rise... appear" -- building through ritual repetition. The chorus is no longer interpreting events but performing an act of summoning. Apollonian metrical discipline houses Dionysiac ritual energy.

---

### Passage 4: Ghost of Darius (moral pronouncement)
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "Behold this vengeance, and remember Greece, / Remember Athens: henceforth let not pride, / Her present state disdaining, strive to grasp / Another's, and her treasured happiness / Shed on the ground: such insolent attempts / Awake the vengeance of offended Jove."

**Why**: The Apollonian moral voice at its purest: gnomic, sententious, measured in syntax and rhythm. Darius speaks as a bounded, authoritative individual delivering intelligible moral wisdom. Suffering has produced knowledge; the cosmos operates according to divine justice.

---

### Passage 5: Exodos kommos (Xerxes commands lamentation)
**Classification**: Dionysiac
> "XERXES: Weep, weep their loss, and lead me to my house; / Answer my grief with grief, an ill return / Of ills for ills. Yet once more raise that strain / Lamenting my misfortunes; beat thy breast, / Strike, heave the groan; awake the Mysian strain / To notes of loudest wo; rend thy rich robes, / Pluck up thy beard, tear off thy hoary locks, / And bathe thine eyes in tears"

**Why**: The verse has become a series of imperatives commanding bodily self-destruction -- "beat," "strike," "rend," "pluck," "tear," "bathe." The formal boundary between actor and chorus has collapsed: Xerxes demands the chorus physically enact his grief. The language has abandoned deliberation for ritual command.

---

### Passage 6: Chorus response in kommos
**Classification**: Dionysiac
> "O wo, wo, wo! Unutterable wo / The demons of revenge have spread; / And Ate from her drear abode below / Rises to view the horrid deed."

**Why**: "O wo, wo, wo! Unutterable wo" -- language acknowledges its own failure. "Unutterable" names what the verse cannot contain, and the threefold repetition is pure sound, rhythm overwhelming semantic content. The verse has ceased to interpret or moralize. It has become the cry itself.

---

### Passage 7: Stichomythic exchange in kommos
**Classification**: Collision point
> "XERXES: Seest thou these poor remains of my rent robes? / CHORUS: I see, I see. / XERXES: And this ill-furnish'd quiver? / CHORUS: Wherefore preserved? / XERXES: To store my treasured arrows. / CHORUS: Few, very few."

**Why**: Formally, this resembles Apollonian stichomythia -- line-by-line exchange. But the spirit has inverted. The exchange does not produce knowledge or deliberation; it produces ritualized stripping-away, each question exposing another absence. The form of stichomythia survives, but its Apollonian function has been hollowed out.

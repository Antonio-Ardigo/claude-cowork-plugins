# Tragedy Classification: Medea

## The Tragedy

**Title**: Medea (*Medeia*)
**Playwright**: Euripides (c. 480-406 BCE)
**First performance**: 431 BCE
**Status**: Complete
**Mythological cycle**: Argonautic (Jason and the Golden Fleece, aftermath)

### Synopsis
Medea, abandoned by Jason for a royal marriage to the princess of Corinth, plots revenge. She feigns reconciliation, sends poisoned gifts (a golden crown and robe) to the princess through her own children, and murders the princess and King Creon. In the play's climactic act, she kills her own children. Jason arrives to find them dead. Medea escapes on the chariot of her grandfather the Sun-god, taking the bodies with her and denying Jason even the right to bury them.

## Six-Dimensional Analysis

### 1. The Chorus
The Chorus of Corinthian Women is unusually engaged -- sympathetic to Medea's plight, they defend women's honor ("Back to their source the holy rivers turn their tide. Order and the universe are being reversed"), plead against the infanticide ("by thy knees we, one and all, implore thee, slay not thy babes"), and at the climactic moment consider breaking the convention of choral non-intervention: "Shall I enter the house? For the children's sake I am resolved to ward off the murder." The odes maintain strophic discipline throughout, their verse formally composed even when emotionally urgent. The chorus never dissolves into ecstatic or incantatory mode; its most extreme moment is the decision to intervene -- a rational, deliberative act, not a Dionysiac eruption.

**Position**: Apollonian -- The chorus maintains rational, deliberative engagement throughout. Even its unprecedented impulse to intervene is expressed as reasoned decision, not ecstatic dissolution.

### 2. Individuation
Medea is one of the most powerfully individuated characters in all surviving tragedy. Her speeches are forensic masterworks of strategic intelligence: the accusation against Jason catalogs his betrayals with prosecutorial precision; the plotting monologue ("I will lay low in death three of my enemies") is deliberative reason applied to revenge; the deception scene, in which she feigns reconciliation, is Apollonian rhetoric wielded as a lethal weapon -- every soft word calculated, every tear strategically deployed. The great deliberation scene, where she wavers between mercy and murder ("O my babes, my babes... but passion, that cause of direst woes to mortal man, hath triumphed o'er my sober thoughts"), is uniquely interior -- Medea argues with her own heart. Yet the argument is articulate, self-aware, formally composed. Even at the point of dissolution, Medea's selfhood holds: she acts from full knowledge of what she does. Jason, by contrast, is individuated as a man of shallow rhetoric, whose composed self-justification ("I am prudent herein, next chastened in my love") the play systematically exposes.

**Position**: Apollonian -- Medea maintains supreme Apollonian individuation throughout. Her plotting, deception, and even her wavering are articulated through forensic, self-possessed speech. The principium individuationis is never dissolved; it is maintained through the most extreme act.

### 3. Suffering
The Messenger's report of the princess's death is one of the most graphically composed narrations in tragedy -- flesh peeling from bone "e'en as when the pine-tree weeps its tears of pitch," the golden crown "sending forth a wondrous stream of ravening flame," Creon's body fusing with his daughter's in death. This is Apollonian narration pushed to the limit of what composed form can contain -- the imagery is so vivid that it borders on enactment. But the children's cries from within ("Ah, me; what can I do? Whither fly to escape my mother's blows?") are the play's Dionysiac eruption: raw voices breaking through the dramatic surface from behind the skene, suffering that cannot be composed into narration because it is happening now.

**Position**: Mixed -- The Messenger's speech is masterful Apollonian narration of horror, but the children's offstage cries rupture the narrative frame, introducing unmediated suffering into the dramatic present.

### 4. Resolution
The play refuses resolution. Medea escapes on the Sun-god's chariot -- a deus ex machina that denies Jason, the chorus, and the audience the Apollonian pattern of transgression, punishment, and moral restoration. The transgressor is not punished; the cosmos does not vindicate justice; pathei mathos is denied. Jason is left with nothing -- no children, no bride, no moral framework in which to understand what has happened. The final exchange between Medea (above, divine) and Jason (below, mortal) is a stichomythia of pure irreconcilability. The play's ending is one of the most Dionysiac in the corpus: the Apollonian moral order is shattered, and no wisdom emerges from the suffering.

**Position**: Dionysiac -- The deus ex machina denies moral resolution. The transgressor escapes; divine intervention enables rather than punishes the crime. The ending shatters the Apollonian pattern of intelligible cosmic justice.

### 5. Language and Music
The dominant register is forensic rhetoric at its most elaborate. The Medea-Jason agon (genuine quarrel) is among the most sustained agonistic exchanges in tragedy: accusation, counter-argument, rebuttal, each speech building its case with logical structure and rhetorical force. The deception scene (feigned reconciliation) is supreme Apollonian manipulation: Medea's language is perfectly calibrated, each word designed to deceive. The great deliberation is uniquely interior forensic debate -- Medea argues with herself as counsel for and against the murder. But the children's cries from within are raw, unstructured sound: "Ah, me!" "We are lost." -- language at its most stripped, devoid of rhetoric, the opposite of everything Medea's speeches represent.

**Position**: Mixed -- The play's dominant register is forensic rhetoric of the highest order, but the children's cries introduce a register of pure, uncomposed anguish that the rhetorical architecture cannot contain.

### 6. Body and Boundaries
The Messenger's narration of the princess's death is among the most graphically bodily passages in tragedy: the crown melting into the head, the robe consuming the flesh, blood and fire mingling, Creon's body fusing with his daughter's. This is narrated (Apollonian convention) but the imagery pushes narration toward the limit of what description can bear. The children's murder occurs offstage but is heard. The final image -- Medea above on the divine chariot, holding her children's bodies -- transgresses the boundary between mortal and divine: a human woman occupying the position of a god, with dead bodies as her trophies. This is boundary violation at the most fundamental level: the mortal/divine distinction itself is breached.

**Position**: Mixed -- Violence is narrated but graphically bodily. The final tableau -- mortal woman on divine chariot with dead children -- transgresses the mortal/divine boundary that Apollonian form depends on maintaining.

## The Tension

### Where the poles collide
The collision point is the deliberation scene and the infanticide. Medea's great speech to her children ("O my babes, my babes, let your mother kiss your hands") is Apollonian rhetoric -- articulate, self-aware, formally composed -- applied to the most Dionysiac act in the corpus. She knows exactly what she is doing, can articulate it with perfect clarity, and does it anyway: "passion, that cause of direst woes to mortal man, hath triumphed o'er my sober thoughts." The Apollonian faculty of self-knowledge does not prevent the Dionysiac act; it accompanies it, making it more terrible, not less.

### The dominant current
The Apollonian dominates by rhetoric. Medea's speeches, the Jason debates, the plotting monologues, and the Messenger's narration are all forensic masterworks. The play is structured as a series of agonistic encounters in which argument is the primary mode.

### Trajectory
From Apollonian control toward Dionysiac transgression. Medea begins as a figure of articulate grief, moves through strategic plotting and rhetorical manipulation, and ends by shattering every moral and cosmic boundary the play has established. The trajectory is not dissolution of form (the verse remains composed) but dissolution of moral order: the Apollonian intelligence achieves a Dionysiac outcome.

### What the tension reveals
Medea stages the most disturbing version of the Apollonian-Dionysiac tension: an Apollonian intelligence that is not merely overwhelmed by Dionysiac forces (as in Agamemnon or The Persians) but uses its own mastery to accomplish Dionysiac destruction. Medea's forensic brilliance is itself the instrument of boundary-violation. The play reveals that the Apollonian principium individuationis, when taken to its extreme, can serve the Dionysiac -- that supreme self-possession and supreme transgression are not opposites but can be aspects of the same will.

**Overall**: MIXTURE (Apollonian rhetoric serving Dionysiac transgression)

### Classification Statement
Medea is built on the most sustained forensic rhetoric in Euripides. Medea's speeches are models of Apollonian self-possession: strategic, articulate, forensically precise, maintained through plotting, deception, wavering, and murder. The principium individuationis is never dissolved -- Medea acts from full self-knowledge throughout. Yet the play's outcome is profoundly Dionysiac: the deus ex machina denies moral resolution, the transgressor escapes unpunished, the children's cries rupture the dramatic surface, and the final tableau transgresses the mortal/divine boundary. The play's disturbing genius lies in this conjunction: Apollonian intelligence does not oppose the Dionysiac but accomplishes it. Medea's forensic mastery is the instrument of boundary-violation, not its antidote. The play reveals that the most extreme form of Apollonian individuation -- absolute self-possession in the service of absolute will -- is indistinguishable, in its effects, from the most extreme form of Dionysiac transgression.

### Nietzsche's Own View
Nietzsche's relationship to Euripides in The Birth of Tragedy is famously hostile: he accuses Euripides of destroying tragedy by replacing the Dionysiac chorus with Socratic rationalism. Medea would present a challenge to this reading. The play's rhetoric is indeed "Socratic" in its forensic brilliance, but its outcome -- the triumph of passion over reason, the refusal of moral resolution, the escape of the transgressor -- is anything but rationalist. Medea is the figure Nietzsche's framework struggles to accommodate: an Apollonian intelligence in the service of Dionysiac destruction.

## Textual Evidence

### Passage 1: Medea's accusation against Jason
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "I saved thy life, as every Hellene knows... I slew the dragon which guarded the golden fleece... Father and home of my free will I left and came with thee to Iolcos... All this have I done for thee, thou traitor! and thou hast cast me over, taking to thyself another wife."

**Why**: Prosecutorial rhetoric at its most disciplined -- each charge cataloged, each sacrifice enumerated, the argument building toward its devastating conclusion. Medea's language is forensic, self-possessed, strategically structured. The principium individuationis is fully intact: she commands the exchange absolutely.

---

### Passage 2: Medea's plotting monologue
**Classification**: Apollonian
> "Dost think I would ever have fawned on yonder man, unless to gain some end or form some scheme?... Shall I set fire to the bridal mansion, or plunge the whetted sword through their hearts... 'Twere best to take the shortest way -- the way we women are most skilled in -- by poison to destroy them."

**Why**: Deliberative reason applied to revenge with chilling composure. Medea evaluates methods, weighs risks, considers consequences -- the language of strategic planning. The verse maintains its rational, argumentative structure throughout. This is the Apollonian principium individuationis at its most extreme: absolute self-possession in the service of destruction.

---

### Passage 3: The deception scene (feigned reconciliation)
**Classification**: Collision point
> "I yield and do confess that I was wrong then, but now have I come to a better mind. Come hither, my children, come, leave the house... Take his right hand; ah me! my sad fate! when I reflect, as now, upon the hidden future."

**Why**: Medea's language is perfectly calibrated deception -- every word of submission calculated to disarm Jason. But the aside ("ah me! my sad fate! when I reflect... upon the hidden future") cracks the surface: genuine grief erupts through the strategic mask. The Apollonian form of reconciliation is used to accomplish its opposite, while the hidden emotional truth bleeds through in the asides.

---

### Passage 4: The great deliberation
**Classification**: Collision point
> "O my babes, my babes, let your mother kiss your hands. Ah! hands I love so well, O lips most dear to me! O noble form and features of my children... Go, leave me; I cannot bear to longer look upon ye; my sorrow wins the day. At last I understand the awful deed I am to do; but passion, that cause of direst woes to mortal man, hath triumphed o'er my sober thoughts."

**Why**: The collision of Apollonian self-knowledge and Dionysiac passion is stated explicitly: "passion... hath triumphed o'er my sober thoughts." The language remains articulate, self-aware, formally composed -- Medea can name exactly what is happening to her. But the naming does not prevent the act. The Apollonian faculty of understanding accompanies the Dionysiac act of transgression without being able to stop it.

---

### Passage 5: Children's cries from within
**Classification**: Dionysiac
> "FIRST SON: Ah, me; what can I do? Whither fly to escape my mother's blows? / SECOND SON: I know not, sweet brother mine; we are lost."

**Why**: Raw, unstructured voices breaking through the dramatic surface from behind the skene. No rhetoric, no argument, no formal composition -- just the sound of suffering in the present tense. This is the Dionysiac eruption that the play's forensic architecture has been building toward: the moment when composed speech gives way to the cry.

---

### Passage 6: Messenger's report of the princess's death
**Classification**: Collision point
> "From her bones the flesh kept peeling off beneath the gnawing of those secret drugs, e'en as when the pine-tree weeps its tears of pitch, a fearsome sight to see... He strove to rise, but she still held him back; and if ever he pulled with all his might, from off his bones his aged flesh he tore."

**Why**: Apollonian narration pushed to its absolute limit. The Messenger maintains composed, sequential, rhetorically structured reportage, but the content -- flesh peeling from bone, bodies fusing in death -- exceeds what composed form can comfortably contain. The simile ("as when the pine-tree weeps its tears of pitch") is Apollonian technique (the analogy, the composed image) applied to Dionysiac horror.
